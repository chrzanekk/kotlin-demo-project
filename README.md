This is simple kotlin demo project based on one of old interview tasks. 
For learn purpose only
Little modified (ex. customer service was stand-alone microservice that why tables dont have any relations)

Stack:
- Kotlin 1.9.20
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.1
- Gradle
- Junit 5.10.1
- Mockk 1.13.8
- Testcontainers 1.17.0
- Postgresql - for integration tests
- MySQL - for live tests (POSTMAN)
- HSQLdb - for unit tests

Maybe in future i will modify this little project to:
1. Microservice
2. Small monolith with relations between tables credit and customer
